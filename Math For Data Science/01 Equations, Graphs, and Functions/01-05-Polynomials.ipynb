      "source": "# Polynomials\nSome of the equations we've looked at so far include expressions that are actually *polynomials*; but what *is* a polynomial, and why should you care?\n\nA polynomial is an algebraic expression containing one or more *terms* that each meet some specific criteria. Specifically:\n- Each term can contain:\n - Numeric values that are coefficients or constants (for example 2, -5, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub>)\n - Variables (for example, x, y)\n - Non-negative integer exponents (for example <sup>2</sup>, <sup>64</sup>)\n- The terms can be combined using arithmetic operations - but **not** division by a variable.\n\nFor example, the following expression is a polynomial:\n\n\\begin{equation}12x^{3} + 2x - 16 \\end{equation}\n\nWhen identifying the terms in a polynomial, it's important to correctly interpret the arithmetic addition and subtraction operators as the sign for the term that follows. For example, the polynomial above contains the following three terms:\n- 12x<sup>3</sup>\n- 2x\n- -16\n\nThe terms themselves include:\n- Two coefficients(12 and 2) and a constant (-16)\n- A variable (x)\n- An exponent (<sup>3</sup>)\n\nA polynomial that contains three terms is also known as a *trinomial*. Similarly, a polynomial with two terms is known as a *binomial* and a polynomial with only one term is known as a *monomial*.\n\nSo why do we care? Well, polynomials have some useful properties that make them easy to work with. for example, if you multiply, add, or subtract a polynomial, the result is always another polynomial.\n\n## Standard Form for Polynomials\nTechbnically, you can write the terms of a polynomial in any order; but the *standard form* for a polynomial is to start with the highest *degree* first and constants last. The degree of a term is the highest order (exponent) in the term, and the highest order in a polynomial determines the degree of the polynomial itself.\n\nFor example, consider the following expression:\n\\begin{equation}3x + 4xy^{2} - 3 + x^{3} \\end{equation}\n\nTo express this as a polynomial in the standard form, we need to re-order the terms like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}x^{3} + 4xy^{2} + 3x - 3 \\end{equation}\n\n## Simplifying Polynomials\nWe saw previously how you can simplify an equation by combining *like terms*. You can simplify polynomials in the same way.\n\nFor example, look at the following polynomial:\n\n\\begin{equation}x^{3} + 2x^{3} - 3x - x + 8 - 3 \\end{equation}\n\nIn this case, we can combine x<sup>3</sup> and 2x<sup>3</sup> by adding them to make 3x<sup>3</sup>. Then we can add -3x and -x (which is really just a shorthand way to say -1x) to get -4x, and then add 8 and -3 to get 5. Our simplified polynomial then looks like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}3x^{3} - 4x + 5 \\end{equation}\n\nWe can use Python to compare the original and simplified polynomials to check them - using an arbitrary random value for ***x***:"

For the first fraction, 2x goes into 4x twice, so the fraction simplifies to 2; and for the second, 6x<sup>2</sup> is 2x mutliplied by 3x. So our answer is 2 + 3x:\n\n\\begin{equation}2 + 3x\\end{equation}\n\nLet's use Python to compare the original fraction with the simplified result for an arbitrary value of ***x***:"

X goes into x<sup>2</sup> x times, so we put an x on top and then multiply it through the divisor:\n\\begin{equation} \\;\\;\\;\\;x \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}x - 2 |\\overline{x^{2} + 2x - 3} \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation} \\;x^{2} -2x \\end{equation}\n\nNow we'll subtract the remaining dividend, and then carry down the -3 that we haven't used to see what's left:\n\\begin{equation} \\;\\;\\;\\;x \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}x - 2 |\\overline{x^{2} + 2x - 3} \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}- (x^{2} -2x) \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\overline{\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;4x -3} \\end{equation}\n\nOK, now we'll divide our highest order divisor into the highest order of the remaining dividend.
